        <p>The things are in the console. We use the console so it's easier to see code for some funtions and also mistakes and errors in code. The console also tells us where and what the problem is. We open the console by right-clicking on the website then pressing inspect. After that, we press on the console tab inside the inspect menu. We can print things in to console by doing typing console.log("thing you want to print into console"/number/variable)</p>
